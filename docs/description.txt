Please see the Coding Challenge attached. You can read a few tips and the content of the challenge in the file attached.

With a timeline in mind, it would be great if you could complete and return this challenge by next Monday the 25th.

We recommend time-box your work on this challenge to 4 hours. It’s okay not to finish; it’s not a typing speed test! It is certainly possible to spend more than 4 hours on this challenge if you feel you’d like to go the extra mile, just please indicate how much time did you spent in the end. The team will be looking to see how you prioritize and what you deliver with the time you spent on it.
